# Node.js-exercises
Source code from my attempt(s) at learning Node.

The plan
--------

My plan is to read and do exercises from these books:

1. „The Node Beginner Book“ by M. Kiessling (**Done**)
2. „Node.js the Right Way“ by J. Wilson (**In process**)
3. „Rapid Prototyping with JS“ by A. Mardan (ToDo)

After that, I'll start on something bigger.
